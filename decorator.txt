Decorator Design Pattern:

- It is a structural design pattern.

- Used to modify the behaviour of an object at runtime.

- Other instances of the same class will not be affected by this modification, only the individual object gets the modified behaviour.

- Inheritance or composition are used to extend the behaviour of an object at compile time and applies to all instances of the class.

- The decorator class acts as a wrapper to the existing class it is extended to.  It provides additional functionality to the original class.

- It is easy to maintin and extend when the number of choices are increased.
